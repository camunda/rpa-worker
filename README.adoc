= Camunda RPA Worker

The Camunda RPA Runtime is designed to bridge the gap between Robotic Process Automation (RPA) bots and the Camunda
workflow engine, enabling you to seamlessly integrate your task workers with Camunda.

NOTE: *Experimental Features Notice:* The code in this repository is in the experimental stage and may be unstable.
Use at your own risk and avoid using in production environments.


== Getting Started

=== Obtaining the RPA Worker

Downloads and details for container images are available on the  https://github.com/camunda/rpa-worker/releases[Releases]
page.

=== Configuration

The RPA Worker can source its configuration either from a configuration file, or environment variables. The RPA Worker
will look for a file named `rpa-worker.properties` in the current directory.

==== Zeebe

Connecting to a Camunda cluster requires providing the configuration for the Zeebe client. The RPA Worker uses the
https://docs.camunda.io/docs/apis-tools/spring-zeebe-sdk/getting-started/#[Spring Zeebe] client, and so uses the same
https://docs.camunda.io/docs/apis-tools/spring-zeebe-sdk/getting-started/#configuring-the-camunda-8-connection[Configuration Properties].

.Example Camunda self-hosted configuration
----
camunda.client.mode=selfmanaged
camunda.client.zeebe.enabled=true
camunda.client.zeebe.grpc-address=http://zeebe.camunda.local
camunda.client.zeebe.rest-address=http://zeebe.camunda.local
----

.Example Camunda SaaS configuration
----
camunda.client.mode=saas
camunda.client.auth.client-id=<client id>
camunda.client.auth.client-secret=<client secret>
camunda.client.cluster-id=<cluster id>
camunda.client.region=<region>
----

TIP: When creating an API client in the Camunda Cloud Console, the autogenerated configuration file provided contains
all the necessary configuration for connecting to Camunda, and can be used as-is.
